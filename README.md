## 🚀 Overview

PhishNet Lite is a full-stack cybersecurity web application that detects phishing websites in real time. It analyzes URLs using advanced rule-based heuristics combined with Google Safe Browsing API integration, domain age analysis, and stores results in a cloud database for logging and analytics.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔍 **Real-time URL scanning** with instant results
* 🧠 **Advanced rule-based detection engine** with 10+ phishing indicators
* 🌐 **Google Safe Browsing integration** for threat intelligence
* 🦠 **Domain age analysis** using WHOIS data
* 📊 **MongoDB Atlas logging system** for result tracking
* ⚡ **Fast and responsive UI** with smooth animations
* 🎨 **Futuristic animated interface** with particle effects and frosted glass design
* 📱 **Responsive design** for all devices
* 🔒 **CORS-enabled API** for secure cross-origin requests

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input**: User enters a URL in the web interface
2. **Frontend Processing**: JavaScript validates and sends POST request to backend API
3. **Backend Analysis**: Flask server analyzes URL using multiple detection methods:
   - Rule-based detection (suspicious keywords, URL patterns, IP addresses)
   - Brand spoofing detection (Google, Facebook, banking sites)
   - Google Safe Browsing API check
   - Domain age verification using WHOIS
4. **Classification**: Result classified as Safe ✅, Suspicious ⚠️, or Phishing ❌
5. **Logging**: All results stored in MongoDB Atlas for analytics
6. **Response**: Real-time result displayed with detection source

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for Netlify CLI, optional)
- Git

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niladri06dey-ship-it/PhishNet-Lite.git
cd PhishNet-Lite
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file with your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys:
# MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_safe_browsing_api_key
```

> **⚠️ Security Warning:** Never commit `.env` files to version control. They contain sensitive API keys and database credentials. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude `.env` files.

### 3. Run Locally

```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend
python app.py
# Server runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000

# Open frontend in browser
# Navigate to frontend/index.html
```

### 4. API Testing

```bash
# Test the API
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://google.com"}'
```

## 🌐 Deployment

### Backend (Railway)
1. Connect GitHub repo to Railway
2. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `MONGO_URI`
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch
4. Backend URL: `https://web-production-c7a81.up.railway.app`

### Frontend (Netlify)
1. Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
2. Set build settings:
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `frontend`
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch
4. Frontend URL: `https://phishnet-lite.netlify.app`

### Environment Variables Required
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/phishnet
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## 🔍 Detection Rules

The system uses 10+ sophisticated detection rules:

1. **HTTP Protocol**: URLs using HTTP instead of HTTPS
2. **Suspicious Keywords**: Login, verify, secure, password, etc.
3. **URL Length**: URLs longer than 75 characters
4. **At Symbol**: Presence of @ in URL
5. **Suspicious TLDs**: .xyz, .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq
6. **Multiple Dots**: More than 3 dots in domain
7. **IP Addresses**: Direct IP usage instead of domain names
8. **Excessive Hyphens**: More than 2 hyphens in URL
9. **Brand Spoofing**: Impersonation of major brands
10. **Domain Age**: Newly registered domains (< 30 days)
